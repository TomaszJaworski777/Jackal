## Overview
Jackal is the chess engine I'm currently developing as a follow-up to [Javelin](https://github.com/TomaszJaworski777/Javelin). It's designed to be a hyper-aggressive engine, still using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) but with a more focused push toward sharp, tactical play. The idea is to create something that consistently seeks out high-risk, high-reward positions.

I'm building Jackal with everything I learned from developing Javelin, especially around training value and policy neural networks through self-play. It's learning entirely through self-play from noise, but Iâ€™ve been adjusting the training process to encourage more aggressive behavior. It also uses my legal move generator, [Spear](https://github.com/TomaszJaworski777/Spear).

## Compiling
1. Download the source code
2. Run `make` command in root folder
3. Binary called `jackal_dev` should appear in the root folder

## Credits
Jackal is developed by Tomasz Jaworski. Special thanks to:

* [@jw1912](https://github.com/jw1912) for helping me with my previous engine, which allowed me to make Jackal.
* [@jw1912](https://github.com/jw1912) for creating [goober](https://github.com/jw1912/goober), that I used for policy training and inference.
* [@jw1912](https://github.com/jw1912) for creating [bullet](https://github.com/jw1912/bullet), that I used for value net training.
* [@Viren6](https://github.com/Viren6) for helping me with concepts of aggressivness in MCTS.

## Command List
Jackal supports all necessary commands to initialize UCI protocol, full description of the protocol can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/DOBRO/2592c6dad754ba67e6dcaec8c90165bf). Here are additional commands:
* `draw` - Draws the board in the terminal.
* `eval` - Shows evaluation of current position.
* `tree <depth>` - Draws tree of most recent search.
* `perft <depth>` - Runs perft test on current position.
* `bulk <depth>` - Runs perft test on current position in bulk mode.
* `moves` - Prints all legal moves together with thier policy.

## Feature List
* MCTS Search
   * Tree Reuse
   * Softmax policy temperature at root
   * Replacement of least recently used node
   * First play urgency
   * Scaling C with search duration
   * Exploration scaling
   * Gini impurity in exploration
   * Variance scaling
   * Hashtable with value network results
   * Multithreading
   * Extended time manager
* Value Network
   * Architecture: `768x4->1024->3`
   * WDL net
   * Horizontal mirroring based on kings file
   * Threats and defences inputs
* Policy Network
   * Architecture: 128 subnet pairs `768->32->32`
   * Selecting subnet pair for move destination based on SEE result

Jackal currently supports multiple threads, but due to some unidentified bug it doesn't play better with more than 1 thread. ($100 for fixing PR)

## EAS
I measured Jackal's EAS to be around 230k, while I also noticed it is very slow to end the games and draws a lot of winning positions. My current guess is that MCTS heavily relies on its neural nets and my current data is just not strong enough to be efficient in end games.

| EAS Score| Sacs | Shorts | Bad draws | Avg. win moves  | Engine/player  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 229966 | 40.00% | 26.71% | 17.36% | 103 | Jackal |

List of featues increasing EAS:
- Policy bonus to sacrifices
- Filtering positions to only those where sides with lower material won the game
- Asymmetrical contempt in PUCT
- Bonus to positions that have less material than root position
